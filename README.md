### Pyber Observations
For this assignment we have been given the complete records of rides for the rideshare company known as Pyber. It is a supposed fledgling company attempting to compete with companies such as Uber and Lyft. Based on the data provided we are able to observe a few trends that will help Pyber make some improvements.

As expected, Pyber and ridesharing apps in general are more popular in urban areas. Just over 80% of all Pyber drivers are in the urban areas and less than 3% are rural. This presents an opportunity for Pyber to expand in both the rural and suburban markets by deploying more drivers in those areas. Especially since the total fares in rural areas appears to be more than you would expect based on their driver count. 

Population density is likely one of the factors for the differences between fares and ridership in the different city types. Although there are less riders in rural areas, the distance they are travelling are greater. That is assuming of course that fares are based on cost per mile. 

I would encourage Pyber to make work on increasing their market share in the suburban and rural sectors. Perhaps they could incentives drivers to travel outside the urban areas. In addition, decreasing the supply of drivers in the urban market for a predetermined amount of time may increase the demand in that market which would then justify an increase in price.
